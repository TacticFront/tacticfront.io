## Responsibility Acknowledgment

- [ ] I confirm I have thoroughly tested these changes and take full responsibility for any bugs introduced
- [ ] I understand that submitting code with bugs that could have been caught through basic manual testing:
  - Significantly slows down the entire development process
  - Blocks releases and new features for all contributors
  - Harms the project's reliability and reputation
  - Places additional debugging burden on maintainers who already have limited time
  - Diverts valuable resources away from new development and improvements
